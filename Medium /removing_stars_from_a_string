class Solution:
    def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for i in range(0, len(s)):
            if s[i] == '*' : 
# if * appear, we will remove the exist non-star character in the stack and not add the *
                stack.pop() #remove the last, stack is last in first out
            else:
                stack.append(s[i]) #add
        return ''.join(stack) #use join method to combine the string


# Time complexity: Time complextity is O(n) because we iterate throguh s every character and then we either push it to the stack or pop the top character from the stack. It takes O(n) time for n characters.
# To form the answer string, we remove all characters from the stack
